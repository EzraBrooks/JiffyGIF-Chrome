JiffyGIF
===
JiffyGIF is a Chrome extension powered by the [gfycat API](http://www.gfycat.com/api) that will automagically check if a GIF you're clicking on has been uploaded and converted to HTML5 video yet or not, and if it hasn't, converting it. In the future, I hope to also include the ability to replace GIFs embedded in a page with embedded HTML5 video.
