JiffyGIF
===
JiffyGIF is a Chrome extension powered by the [gfycat API](http://www.gfycat.com/api) that will automagically check if a GIF you're clicking on has been uploaded and converted to HTML5 video yet or not, and if it hasn't, converting it. In the future, I hope to also include the ability to replace GIFs embedded in a page with embedded HTML5 video.  
You may notice that JiffyGIF is a "persistent" Chrome extension, as per its manifest. That means that Chrome keeps the script loaded at all times. The integral API to a user-friendly extension that redirects to different URLs (like JiffyGIF or EFF's [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere)) is webRequest and its sister API webRequestBlocking, which aren't available to non-persistent, or "event," extensions. To reduce the performance load, I try to keep JiffyGIF's code concise and efficient and make sure nothing is running all the time; it sets up event listeners to trigger things when they're needed, and never otherwise.
